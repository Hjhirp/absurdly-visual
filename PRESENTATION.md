## Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you handle video generation latency?**
A: We use aggressive caching (permanent for winners, 24hr for popular combos) and Veo3 Fast mode. Most videos are instant from cache.

**Q: What if Fetch.ai agents fail?**
A: We have fallback mock modes for testing, and the system gracefully degrades to text-only if needed.

**Q: How does the AI select cards?**
A: Gemini analyzes the black card context and available white cards, considering humor, timing, and personality type.

**Q: Can it scale to many concurrent games?**
A: Yes! Stateless backend design, Redis for shared state, and horizontal scaling ready. Agents scale independently.

**Q: What about inappropriate content?**
A: Three censorship levels (none, mild, family) with NSFW filtering and video prompt sanitization.

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the monetization strategy?**
A: Premium card packs, custom video styles, tournaments, and API access for developers.

**Q: Who's the target audience?**
A: Party gamers, streamers, and anyone who loves Cards Against Humanity. Ages 18+.

**Q: What's the competitive advantage?**
A: Only multimodal CAH game with AI videos. Viral potential and unique content every time.

### Fetch.ai Questions

**Q: Why use Fetch.ai agents?**
A: Perfect for distributed AI orchestration, scalable architecture, and blockchain-ready for future features.

**Q: Could this work without agents?**
A: Yes, but agents provide better separation of concerns, independent scaling, and easier maintenance.

**Q: Plans for Fetch.ai integration?**
A: Potential for agent marketplace, token-based rewards, and decentralized tournament hosting.
